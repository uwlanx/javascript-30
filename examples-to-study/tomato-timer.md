# Case Study: Tomato Timer

Let's see these questions in action with a simple website:

* [tomato timer](https://tomato-timer.com/)

Here are some possible answers to these questions based on the Tomato Timer

(but not the only answers! there are many ways to split a project):

* * *

### 1\. What are the different components on the user interface?

* There is a red button that says "stop"
* There is a white button that says "reset"
* There are some numbers
* There is a green button that says "start"

### 2\. What interaction does each component enable a user to have with your website?

* A user can stop the count-down without resetting the time
* A user can stop the count-down and set it back to 25:00
* A user can see how much time is left
* A user can start (or restart!) the count-down

### 3\. How do these stories depend on each other?

* You can't stop a count-down unless it is started
* It is not practical to be able to reset the count-down every time you want to stop it
* You can see how much time is left without being able to start the timer (even if this isn't very useful :)
* There is no point to have a count-down until there is a time to see

### 4\. What is a logical order for building these stories?

1. A user can see how much time is left
2. A user can start (or restart!) the count-down
3. A user can stop the count-down without resetting the time
4. A user can stop the count-down and set it back to 25:00
