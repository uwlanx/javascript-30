# Project Breakdown Examples

Learning to break a whole application into actionable steps takes lots practice.  This is easier to learn by practicing with existing applications instead of ones you create yourself. Why? Because this is how you learn to build them by yourself!

The first step to mastering user stories is to practice asking and answering these questions:

## Project Planning

1. **What are the different components on the user interface?**
1. **What interaction does each component enable a user to have with your website?**
1. **How do these stories depend on each other?**
1. **What is a logical order for building these stories?**

## Code Planning

1. **What are the main concerns in this project? (ie. is there logic? is there state?)**
1. **What is a good way to organize your code, based on the main concerns? (what files & folders?)**
1. **Which files will need to be developed for each user story?**

1. [Drum Kit](https://github.com/HackYourFutureBelgium/drum-kit) - A complete repository for the Drum Kit challenge by Wes Bos.  It has everything!
    * Issues with labels & milestones
    * A project board
    * Branches for each user story
    * A full README (or at least as much as you need for this project :)
    * A complete Development Strategy
    * Code refactored and separated by concern
